Sample code:	code snippet:1	for (this.i = 0; this.i < 9; this.i += 1)
        				this.ch[this.i] = 'B';
			
			Explanation: Initially all the cells are give a characters 'B' which means they are empty. 

		code snippet:2	for (this.i = 0; this.i < 3; this.i += 1)//--------checking vertically
        			{
            				if ((this.ch[this.i] != 'B') &&
            				(this.ch[(this.i + 3)] == this.ch[this.i]) && (this.ch[(this.i + 6)] == this.ch[this.i]))
           				{
                				new Board().win();
                				bug = 1;
